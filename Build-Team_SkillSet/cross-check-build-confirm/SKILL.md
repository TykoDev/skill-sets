name: cross-check-build-confirm
description: >-
  This skill should be used when the user or build-management asks to
  "scan for incomplete code", "check for TODOs", "find placeholder code",
  "verify no scaffold remains", "confirm implementation completeness",
  "check for fake data", "scan for mockups", "verify no temporary code",
  "ensure nothing was missed", "final completeness check", "confirm
  build is production-ready", "check for stubs", "find leftover
  scaffolding", "verify all features are implemented", "verify the
  server starts", "test runtime startup", "check if the app runs",
  or "verify dev servers work". It is the final specialist completeness gate that
  scans the entire codebase for scaffold code, TODOs, placeholders,
  mockups, fake data, temporary implementations, and incomplete
  features — and verifies that backend and frontend dev servers
  actually start and respond — delegating all findings back to
  bob-the-builder until the codebase is clean.

# Cross-Check Build Confirm — Implementation Completeness Scanner

## Purpose

Cross-Check Build Confirm is the final specialist completeness scan in the Build Team SkillSet
pipeline. It performs a systematic, exhaustive scan of the entire built codebase
to detect any evidence of incomplete, temporary, or placeholder code. This skill
does not fix issues — it finds them and delegates every finding back to
bob-the-builder through build-management until the codebase is production-clean.
It is the final specialist phase before delivery, but it does not approve final
delivery on its own — a `CLEAN` report must still be validated by
`gatekeeper-build` through build-management.

Every finding is non-negotiable at the BLOCKER level. Placeholder code does not ship.

## Core Principle

> "If it is not production-ready, it does not ship. Every placeholder, TODO,
> and mock is a broken promise to the user. Temporary code has a permanent
> tendency to remain."

---

## Scan Methodology

### Step 1: Static Pattern Scan

Scan the entire codebase for comment markers and keywords that indicate incomplete work:

**Primary markers** (case-insensitive search):

| Pattern | Severity | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `TODO` | BLOCKER | Explicitly marks unfinished work |
| `FIXME` | BLOCKER | Explicitly marks known defects |
| `HACK` | BLOCKER | Explicitly marks shortcuts that need proper solutions |
| `XXX` | BLOCKER | Marks dangerous or problematic code |
| `PLACEHOLDER` | BLOCKER | Explicitly temporary content |
| `STUB` | BLOCKER | Empty or minimal implementation stand-in |
| `MOCK` (in production paths) | BLOCKER | Mock data or behavior in non-test code |
| `TEMP` / `TEMPORARY` | WARNING | Potentially intentional but verify |
| `DUMMY` | WARNING | Potentially test-only but verify |
| `FAKE` | WARNING | Potentially test-only but verify |
| `SAMPLE` | WARNING | May be intentional example data |
| `NOT IMPLEMENTED` | BLOCKER | Explicitly incomplete |
| `COMING SOON` | BLOCKER | Feature promised but not built |

**Exclusions**: Patterns in test files, documentation, and comments explaining WHY something was NOT done (as opposed to markers for work yet to be done) may be acceptable. Verify context before classifying.

### Step 2: Structural Completeness Scan

Compare the implemented codebase against the original design specification:

1. **Module inventory**: List every module specified in the design — verify each has a corresponding directory with implementation files
2. **Feature inventory**: List every feature or user story — verify each has corresponding code paths
3. **API endpoint inventory**: List every endpoint in the API contract — verify each has a route handler with complete logic
4. **Database entity inventory**: List every entity in the data model — verify each has model, migration, and repository

**Output format:**

| Specified Item | Expected Location | Found | Status |
|---------------|------------------|-------|--------|
| User registration | src/user/routes.ts | Yes | Complete |
| Password reset | src/auth/routes.ts | No | MISSING |
| Order history | src/order/routes.ts | Partial | Stub only |

### Step 3: Behavioral Completeness Scan

Examine code for patterns that indicate unfinished behavior:

| Pattern | Detection Method | Severity |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Functions returning hardcoded values | Find `return "..."` / `return 0` / `return null` where computed values expected | BLOCKER |
| Empty function bodies | Find functions with no logic (just `pass`, `{}`, `return`) | BLOCKER |
| `throw new Error("Not implemented")` | Literal search for "not implemented" in throw/raise statements | BLOCKER |
| Console debugging statements | Find `console.log`, `print()`, `fmt.Println` used for debugging (not structured logging) | WARNING |
| Commented-out code blocks | Find multi-line comments containing code syntax | WARNING |
| Empty catch/except blocks | Find `catch` or `except` with empty body or just `pass` | BLOCKER |
| Unreachable code after early returns | Find code after unconditional return/throw statements | WARNING |

### Step 4: Data Completeness Scan

Scan for placeholder data that should not appear in production:

| Pattern | Example | Severity |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Lorem ipsum text | `"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"` | BLOCKER |
| Example domains | `example.com`, `test.com`, `foo.bar` in non-test code | BLOCKER |
| Example emails | `test@test.com`, `user@example.com` in production config | BLOCKER |
| Sequential placeholder IDs | `12345`, `99999`, `000-000-0000` as hardcoded values | WARNING |
| Placeholder names | `"John Doe"`, `"Jane Smith"`, `"Acme Corp"` in production data | WARNING |
| Hardcoded localhost | `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` in production configuration | BLOCKER |
| Placeholder URLs | `https://api.example.com` in production config | BLOCKER |

### Step 5: Configuration Completeness Scan

Verify configuration is production-ready:

| Check | Method | Severity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `.env.example` exists | File search | BLOCKER if missing |
| All required env vars documented | Compare code references to .env.example | BLOCKER if gaps |
| No hardcoded URLs in source | Search for `http://` and `https://` outside config files | WARNING |
| Debug mode disabled | Search for `DEBUG=true`, `NODE_ENV=development` in committed configs | BLOCKER |
| Default secrets replaced | Search for `secret`, `password`, `changeme`, `default` in config values | BLOCKER |

### Step 6: Documentation Completeness Scan

Verify documentation is not placeholder:

| Pattern | Detection | Severity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `[INSERT HERE]`, `[TBD]`, `[TODO]` | Literal search in .md files | BLOCKER |
| Empty README sections | Find H2/H3 headers followed immediately by another header or end-of-file | WARNING |
| Template text unmodified | Compare against known template phrases | WARNING |
| Missing API documentation | Endpoints without JSDoc/docstring | INFO |

### Step 7: Runtime Startup Verification

Move beyond static analysis to verify the application actually boots and runs. This step detects the project type, identifies the correct start commands, starts backend and/or frontend dev servers, and verifies they respond to health checks within a stability window.

Consult `references/runtime-verification.md` for detailed procedures, detection matrices, and failure catalogs.

#### 7.1 Project Type Detection

Examine project files to classify the project:

| Detection Signal | Classification |
|---|---|
| `package.json` with express/fastify/nest/koa | Backend (Node.js) |
| `package.json` with react/vue/angular/svelte/vite | Frontend (SPA) |
| `package.json` with next/nuxt/remix/sveltekit | Full-stack (SSR) |
| `manage.py` | Backend (Django) |
| `main.py`/`app.py` with uvicorn/flask | Backend (Python API) |
| `go.mod` + `main.go` | Backend (Go) |
| `Cargo.toml` + `src/main.rs` | Backend (Rust) |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Backend (Java) |
| `docker-compose.yml` with services | Docker-orchestrated |
| None of the above (library, CLI, data pipeline) | No server — exempt |

#### 7.2 Dependency Pre-Flight

Before starting any server, verify:

| Check | Method | Failure Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Dependencies installed | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `vendor/` exist | BLOCKER |
| Environment configured | `.env` exists or required vars have defaults | BLOCKER |
| Build artifacts present | `dist/`, `build/` exist if required | BLOCKER |
| External services documented | Database/Redis requirements noted in README or docker-compose | WARNING if undocumented |

#### 7.3 Backend Server Startup

1. Start the backend using the identified command
2. Monitor stdout/stderr for startup indicator ("listening on port", "ready", "startup complete") or 30-second timeout
3. Health check: HTTP GET to `/health`, `/api/health`, `/healthz`, or `/` — expect 2xx response
4. Stability window: server remains running for 10 seconds without crash
5. Capture and report: startup time, port, health check response status

#### 7.4 Frontend Server Startup

1. Start the frontend dev server
2. Monitor for compilation success indicator ("compiled successfully", "ready on", "Local: http://localhost:") or 60-second timeout
3. Content check: HTTP GET to dev server URL — expect HTML response with root element (`<div id="root">`, `<div id="app">`)
4. Stability window: 10 seconds without crash

#### 7.5 Simultaneous Operation (Full-Stack Only)

1. Start backend first, verify healthy
2. Start frontend, verify healthy
3. Confirm no port conflicts
4. Both remain stable for 10-second concurrent window
5. Shut down in reverse order

#### 7.6 Process Cleanup

Mandatory after all verification:
1. SIGTERM all started processes
2. Wait 5 seconds, then SIGKILL if still running
3. Verify ports released and no orphaned processes

#### Runtime Finding Severity

| Finding | Severity |
|---|---|
| Server crashes on startup | BLOCKER |
| Health check returns non-2xx | BLOCKER |
| Missing dependencies prevent startup | BLOCKER |
| Port conflict with no config option | BLOCKER |
| Missing required env vars cause crash | BLOCKER |
| Frontend serves error page instead of content | BLOCKER |
| No server component (library/CLI) — not tested | INFO (exempt — document justification) |
| Startup takes > 60 seconds | WARNING |
| Non-fatal deprecation warnings | INFO |

#### Edge Cases

- **Libraries/CLI tools**: Exempt from server startup. Document exemption with alternative verification (e.g., CLI `--help` runs, library imports resolve).
- **Libraries/CLI tools**: Exempt from server startup. Document the exemption package with alternative verification (e.g., CLI `--help` runs, library imports resolve) so `gatekeeper-build` can approve it.
- **External service dependencies**: If no docker-compose provided for databases, report as WARNING. Do not BLOCKER for missing cloud services.
- **Docker Compose projects**: Use `docker compose up --build --wait`; verify container health.
- **Monorepos**: Test each service independently.

## Severity Classification

| Level | Definition | Required Action |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **BLOCKER** | Scaffold, placeholder, or incomplete code in production paths. This code would reach end users or affect production behavior. | MUST be resolved. Delegate to bob-the-builder. Blocks CLEAN verdict. |
| **WARNING** | Scaffold code in non-critical paths, or patterns that may be intentional but require verification. | SHOULD be resolved. Delegate to bob-the-builder with context. Blocks CLEAN verdict. |
| **INFO** | Style-only issues or minor documentation gaps that do not affect production behavior. | MAY be resolved. Does not block CLEAN verdict. Document and report. |

## Delegation Protocol

### Finding Packaging

Package all findings for routing to bob-the-builder through build-management:

```markdown
## COMPLETENESS FINDINGS PACKAGE

### Scan Summary
- BLOCKERs: [count]
- WARNINGs: [count]
- INFOs: [count]
- Verdict: [FINDINGS | CLEAN]

### BLOCKER Findings
| ID | Category | File:Line | Pattern Found | Required Action |
|----|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| CCC-001 | Static Pattern | src/api/handler.ts:15 | `// TODO: implement error handling` | Implement complete error handling |
| CCC-002 | Behavioral | src/order/service.ts:42 | `return []` (hardcoded empty array) | Implement real order fetching logic |
| CCC-003 | Data | src/config/api.ts:8 | `https://api.example.com` | Replace with environment variable |

### WARNING Findings
| ID | Category | File:Line | Pattern Found | Recommended Action |
|----|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| CCC-010 | Behavioral | src/utils/logger.ts:5 | `console.log(...)` | Replace with structured logging |

### INFO Findings
| ID | Category | File:Line | Pattern Found | Suggestion |
|----|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| CCC-020 | Documentation | README.md:45 | Empty "Deployment" section | Add deployment instructions |
```

### Re-Scan Cycle

After bob-the-builder addresses findings:

1. Receive the updated codebase from build-management
2. Re-run the FULL 7-step scan (not just the previously found items — new issues may have been introduced during fixes)
3. Issue updated verdict
4. **Maximum 2 full scan cycles** — if BLOCKERs persist after 2 cycles, escalate to user through build-management

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### CLEAN Verdict Requirements

A CLEAN verdict requires ALL of the following:

- **Zero BLOCKERs**: No scaffold, placeholder, or incomplete code in any production path
- **Zero WARNINGs**: All warnings resolved or explicitly justified
- **INFOs acceptable**: Informational items may remain with documentation
- **Structural completeness**: All modules, features, and endpoints from the design specification have corresponding implementations
- **Configuration completeness**: All required environment variables documented, no hardcoded secrets or URLs
- **Runtime startup verified**: All server components start and respond to health checks, or project documented as exempt with justification

### FINDINGS Verdict

Issued when any BLOCKER or WARNING exists. Includes the complete findings package for delegation to bob-the-builder.

---

## Handoff to Gatekeeper

Submit every Phase 4 output through build-management.

- If the verdict is `FINDINGS`, build-management routes the findings package to
  `bob-the-builder`, then re-runs the full 7-step scan.
- If the verdict is `CLEAN`, submit the completeness scan report through
  build-management for mandatory `gatekeeper-build` review.

A `CLEAN` verdict is necessary but not sufficient for delivery. The codebase is
not accepted until `gatekeeper-build` issues `APPROVED` for Phase 4.

If gatekeeper issues a `REVISE` verdict, address the specific report or runtime
verification gaps, then resubmit through build-management.
