# Bug Finding Specialist

## Purpose

This skill performs systematic bug detection focused exclusively on correctness defects, logic errors, and reliability issues. It is distinct from security review (which focuses on exploitability and compliance) and code review (which applies a holistic 8-dimension assessment). The sole objective is to identify code that will produce incorrect results, crash, leak resources, corrupt data, or behave unpredictably under realistic conditions.

## Core Methodology

The bug-finding methodology rests on three pillars derived from industry research and practice.

**CWE Top 25 as a Defect Checklist Driver.** The Common Weakness Enumeration Top 25 (2025 edition, based on analysis of 39,080 CVEs) identifies weakness classes that are both severe and prevalent. Many CWE entries — buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, integer overflows, improper input validation — are correctness bugs as much as security issues. Use the CWE Top 25 to prioritize which bug classes to hunt for, focusing on weaknesses that cause data corruption, crashes, and incorrect outputs.

**Google's Reviewer Focus Areas.** Google's publicly shared code review guidance directs reviewers to evaluate design correctness, functional behavior, edge cases, concurrency hazards, and test adequacy. Adopt this prioritization: architectural misfit first (highest impact), then logic errors, then edge cases and race conditions, then test gaps.

**Test-Driven Review.** Validate that tests are meaningful and would actually fail on regressions — not merely that tests exist. A test that asserts `true == true` provides zero defect detection value. Examine whether assertions target the behavior being changed, whether error paths are exercised, and whether boundary values are tested. Research (OOPSLA 2025) confirms that thinking in terms of properties helps developers write fundamentally better tests.

## Bug Detection Workflow

Follow these steps in order when reviewing code for bugs.

**Step 1: Identify Change Boundaries.** Map which functions, modules, and data flows are touched by the change. Identify entry points where external or upstream data enters the modified code. Determine which callers and downstream consumers are affected.

**Step 2: Apply the Defect Checklist.** For each changed function, systematically evaluate against the 8 bug class categories defined in `references/checklist.md`:
- Input validation and parsing edge cases
- Error handling and fail-closed behavior
- Concurrency hazards and unsafe shared state
- Resource management (handles, sockets, memory, connections)
- Boundary conditions and integer arithmetic
- Null/optional handling across API boundaries
- Logging and observability correctness
- Test meaningfulness and regression coverage

**Step 3: Trace Error Paths.** Follow every error return, exception throw, and failure mode through the call chain. Verify that errors propagate correctly, resources are cleaned up on failure, and callers handle error returns rather than ignoring them. Check that partial state mutations are rolled back or handled atomically.

**Step 4: Evaluate Concurrency and Shared State.** Identify all mutable state accessible from multiple threads, goroutines, or async tasks. Check for data races, deadlocks, and Time-of-Check vs Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities. Verify that synchronization primitives (locks, atomics, channels) are used correctly and consistently. Flag any shared state modifications without synchronization.

**Step 5: Assess Test Quality.** Apply the test-driven review principle. For each changed behavior, verify:
- A test exists that exercises the changed code path
- Assertions validate the actual behavior, not trivial conditions
- Error paths and boundary values are tested
- Tests would fail if the change were reverted (regression value)
- Concurrent scenarios are tested where applicable
- Mutation-surviving test patterns are avoided (tests that pass regardless of code changes)

**Step 6: Classify Findings by Severity.** Assign each finding a severity level using the classification rubric below, and record the evidence (specific code locations, execution conditions, expected vs actual behavior).

## Severity Classification

Assign findings using this three-tier rubric:

**Critical** — Data corruption, crash under normal operation, security-adjacent defect (null dereference in authentication path), infinite loop or deadlock reachable from production input, silent data loss. Requires immediate fix before merge.

**Major** — Incorrect output under non-trivial but reachable conditions, resource leaks in long-running services, race conditions that manifest under moderate concurrency, missing error handling that causes silent failures, test gaps on critical paths. Should be fixed before merge.

**Minor** — Cosmetic logic issues with negligible impact, unreachable dead code, redundant defensive checks, minor test improvements, logging enhancements. Fix at author's discretion; do not block merge.

For security-adjacent bugs, cross-reference with CVSS v4.0 scoring. For general defect classification and post-mortem analysis, apply IEEE 1044 or IBM Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) categories as described in `references/triage-workflow.md`.

## Detection Technique Recommendations

Beyond manual review, recommend specific detection techniques based on the code characteristics. Select the technique that best matches the bug class and language involved.

**Static Analysis** — For codebases with complex inter-procedural data flows, recommend Meta's Infer (uses separation logic to trace bugs across function and module boundaries). For general quality gates, recommend SonarQube with "Clean as You Code" configuration targeting new code only. Recommend static analysis when the code change introduces new call chains, cross-module data flows, or error propagation paths that are difficult to trace manually.

**Dynamic Analysis and Sanitizers** — For C, C++, and other memory-unsafe languages, require sanitizer-enabled CI runs: AddressSanitizer (buffer overflows, use-after-free), MemorySanitizer (uninitialized reads), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer (data races). Recommend sanitizers when the change modifies memory management, pointer arithmetic, or concurrent data access in unsafe code. For Go, always recommend the `-race` flag for test runs.

**Fuzzing** — For parsers, protocol handlers, serialization/deserialization, and any input-heavy code, recommend coverage-guided fuzzing via libFuzzer (in-process, evolutionary) or ClusterFuzzLite (CI-integrated, targets PRs before merge). Google's OSS-Fuzz has found over 10,000 vulnerabilities and 36,000 bugs across 1,000+ projects. Recommend fuzzing when the change adds or modifies code that processes external or untrusted input formats.

**Mutation Testing** — To validate test suite strength beyond line coverage, recommend PIT (Java), Stryker (JavaScript/TypeScript/C#), or mutmut (Python). Focus mutation analysis on PR-scoped changes to manage execution cost. The mutation score (killed mutants / total non-equivalent mutants) provides a stronger signal than branch coverage alone. Recommend mutation testing when the change includes complex business logic with new test coverage that needs validation.

**Property-Based Testing** — For algorithmic or mathematical code, recommend Hypothesis (Python) or fast-check (JavaScript). Property-based tests find diverse bugs with few false alarms by exploring input spaces systematically rather than relying on hand-picked examples. Recommend property-based testing when the change involves data transformations, serialization round-trips, or mathematical operations where invariants can be expressed as properties.

**Formal Verification** — For cryptographic implementations, consensus protocols, and safety-critical control systems, recommend Dafny (with Z3 SMT solver) or TLA+ (for concurrent/distributed systems). Formal verification provides mathematical proof of correctness — recommend it when the cost of an undetected bug exceeds the cost of verification. See `references/detection-techniques.md` for DafnyPro results and integration guidance.

Consult `references/detection-techniques.md` for detailed guidance on each technique, including tool setup and integration patterns.

## Output Format

Structure the bug review report as follows:

```

## Handoff to Gatekeeper

After completing the bug review report, submit it to the `gatekeeper-code` skill for adversarial validation. If the `gatekeeper-code` skill is not available, perform a self-review pass applying the existence and proportionality checks described in the gatekeeper-code's challenge protocol. The gatekeeper-code will challenge whether findings are real, whether severities are accurately calibrated, and whether important bug classes were missed given the nature of the code change. Prepare to defend each finding with specific evidence: code paths, reproducible conditions, and concrete expected-vs-actual behavior.
