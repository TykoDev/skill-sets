# Handoff Templates — Code-Chief Delegations

## Phase Delegation Templates

### Phase 1: bug-review Delegation

```markdown
## CODE-CHIEF DELEGATION: Phase 1 — Correctness Defects

### Review Target
[Scope description: full codebase, PR #N, module X, files Y]

### Technology Stack
[Detected languages, frameworks, runtimes, build tools]

### Risk Tier
[Low / Standard / High — with justification]

### Instruction
Execute the bug-review skill workflow. Apply the full 8-category defect
checklist against the review target. Produce a structured report with:
- Findings classified by severity (Critical / Major / Minor)
- Evidence for each finding (file path, line number, reproducible conditions)
- 8-category checklist coverage percentage
- Overall risk assessment (High / Medium / Low)
- Structured summary block for pipeline consumption

Submit the completed report to code-chief for pipeline continuation.

[Summary of bug-review findings: severity counts, key issues, risk assessment]

### Instruction
Execute the code-review skill workflow. Evaluate the review target across all
8 dimensions (Design, Functionality, Complexity, Tests, Naming, Comments,
Style, Documentation). Produce a structured report with:
- Score per dimension
- PR assessment (size check, risk tier, Ship/Show/Ask classification)
- Merge recommendation (Approve / Approve with Nits / Request Changes)

[Summary of bug-review and code-review findings]

### Instruction
Execute the quality-review skill workflow. Produce a structured report with:
- Standards enforcement assessment (3-layer stack: baseline hygiene, semantic analysis, AI-assisted review)

- Efficiency assessment (algorithmic complexity, resource utilization, database queries)
- Technical debt measurement (duplication, complexity, dependency staleness, TODO density)
- Quality score (Pass / Conditional / Fail)
- Structured summary block for pipeline consumption

Submit the completed report to code-chief for pipeline continuation.

### Review Target
[Scope description]

### Phase 1–3 Context
[Summary of prior phase findings, especially any correctness defects affecting
security-relevant code paths]

### Instruction
Execute the security-review skill workflow. Produce a structured report with:
- Findings mapped to NIST SSDF, OWASP ASVS/Top 10, CWE Top 25
- Risk tier assessment per finding
- Threat model updates (new data flows, trust boundary changes, auth modifications)
- Supply chain assessment (dependency vulnerabilities, SBOM gaps, SCA results)
- STRIDE classification for identified threats
- Structured summary block for pipeline consumption

Submit the completed report to code-chief for pipeline continuation.

### Phase 5: mr-robot Delegation

```markdown
## CODE-CHIEF DELEGATION: Phase 5 — Adversarial Penetration Testing

### Review Target
[Scope description]

### Phase 4 Security Context
[Security-review findings — critical input for targeted exploitation]

### Risk Tier
[Standard / High — Low-risk targets use simplified reconnaissance only]

### Instruction
Execute the mr-robot skill workflow. Using the security-review findings as
input, perform offensive analysis to validate whether identified (and
unidentified) vulnerabilities are exploitable. Produce a structured report with:
- Attack surface map (entry points, trust boundaries, data flows)
- Exploit chain constructions with preconditions and impact analysis
- Supply chain attack surface assessment
- API abuse scenarios (if applicable)
- CVSS 4.0-scored findings with proof-of-concept descriptions
- Structured summary block for pipeline consumption

Submit the completed report to code-chief for pipeline continuation.

### Phase 6: frontier Delegation

```markdown
## CODE-CHIEF DELEGATION: Phase 6 — Frontend Analytics & UI/UX Audit

### Review Target
[Frontend components and files only]

### Frontend Framework
[Detected: React / Vue / Angular / Svelte / vanilla JS / other]

### Phase 1–5 Context
[Summary of prior findings relevant to frontend code]

### Instruction
Execute the frontier skill workflow. Produce a structured report with:
- Performance audit (Core Web Vitals: LCP, INP, CLS against thresholds)
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance)
- Frontend security audit (CSP, Trusted Types, XSS prevention, SRI)
- Component architecture assessment (design quality, state management, error boundaries)
- UI/UX quality review (responsive design, interaction patterns, loading/error/empty states)
- Structured summary block for pipeline consumption

Submit the completed report to code-chief for pipeline continuation.
You are operating in pipeline mode — do NOT submit directly to gatekeeper-code.
